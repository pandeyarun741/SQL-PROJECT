Data Control Language (DCL) in SQL is used to manage permissions and control access to database objects,
ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions. 
The primary DCL commands are GRANT and REVOKE.

************** DCL *******************

// --- 1. GRANT
          The GRANT command provides specific privileges to users on database objects, such as tables, views, or the entire database.
          Permissions can include actions like 
          SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and more.


1------ GRANT---------- 
     1--- GRANT SELECT ON Employees TO User1;     ///  Granting SELECT Privilege


    2--- GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON Employees TO User1;   ///  Granting Multiple Privileges

    3--- GRANT ALL ON Employees TO User1;  /// Granting All Privileges



//---2. REVOKE
        The REVOKE command removes specific privileges from users on database objects.
        This is useful for restricting access when certain permissions are no longer needed


1------REVOKE--------

    1---REVOKE SELECT ON Employees FROM User1;


    2---REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE ON Employees FROM User1;     ///  Granting Multiple Privileges


    3---REVOKE ALL ON Employees FROM User1;           /// Granting All Privileges
